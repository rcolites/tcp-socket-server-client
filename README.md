Simple Python TCP server and client scripts for learning socket programming. Inspired by Black Hat Python.
# TCP Sockets

This repository contains simple Python scripts for a basic TCP server and client, created as part of my learning journey through *Black Hat Python*.

The server accepts incoming TCP connections, prints received data, and responds with an acknowledgment (`ACK`). The client connects to the server and sends a simple message.

These scripts demonstrate low-level socket programming using Python's built-in `socket` and `threading` modules.

## Files

- `TCP_server.py` – Listens for incoming TCP connections on a specified port and handles each client in a separate thread.
- `TCP_client.py` – Connects to the server, sends a message, and prints the server's response.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies

## Usage

Run the server:

```bash
python TCP_server.py
